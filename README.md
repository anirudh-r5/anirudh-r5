# Welcome! 👋
This is my space where I attempt to create something useful 🎆, learn new things 🤔, and (probably) break things along the way 🔨

## About Me ✨
I'm Anirudh and I'm currently a MS student majoring in Computer Science from California State University Fullerton. 📖

I've previously worked as a Data Engineer for 2 years and have dabbled in projects across various areas (full-stack, mobile dev, game dev)
