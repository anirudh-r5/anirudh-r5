# Welcome! 👋
This is my space where I attempt to create something useful 🎆, learn new things 🤔, and (probably) break things along the way 🔨

## About Me ✨
I'm Anirudh and I'm currently a MS student majoring in Computer Science from California State University Fullerton. 📖

I've previously worked as a Data Engineer for 2 years and have dabbled in projects across various areas (full-stack, mobile dev, game dev)

## My Tech Stack 💻
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,nodejs,js,ts,py,aws,docker)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Currently Learning 🌱
- Container orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes
- CI/CD setup and management
- Doing the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) to build a full-stack application with end-to-end automated deployment on AWS
